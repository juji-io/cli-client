## Login and logout

The rest of the functionality of this client requires authentication.

## Upload data to analyze

Juji can perform individual trait analysis based on the text an individual
wrote. The traits currently include big5 personality and many others.

After login, CSV or JSON document containing id and text can be uploaded to Juji to obtain
trait analysis results.


```console
$ juji help analyze
Usage: juji-analyze [options] <file>

Upload a file to Juji for analysis

Options:
  -h, --help  output usage information

Input:
  The input file name should have either .json or .csv suffix. They should have similar structure: csv file should have two columns, the first being an id column, and the second a text column, and there should be no header; json file should be a vector of objects, where each object has two fields, an "id " and a "text"

Output:
  The output will be a csv file with a header, and column names are the name of traits. The output is printed directly to console.

Examples:
  juji analyze mytext.csv
  juji analyze mytext.json > result.csv
```

## GraphQL query and mutation

After login, `juji query` command can be used to send query and mutation to Juji
GraphQL endpoint.

Query string is passed in as is, and the variables need to be the fields of a
JSON object string. The results, a JSON document, is printed to console.

```console
$ juji help query
Usage: juji-query [options] <query>

Issue GraphQL query to Juji

Options:
  -v, --variables [variables]  supplies GraphQL variables in JSON format
  -h, --help                   output usage information

Examples:
  juji query '{getBrands {name}}'
  juji query -v '{"brandName": "mycorp"}' 'query engagements($brandName: String!) {getEngagementsByBrand(brandName: $brandName) {name order status}}'
```

For example, the first example query above returns something like this:

```json
{
  "getBrands": [
    {
      "name": "mycorp"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the second example query above returns something like this:

```json
{
  "getEngagementsByBrand": [
    {
      "name": "Test Analytics",
      "order": 1,
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "name": "AI App 2",
      "order": 2,
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```
